    <h2>Valsgärde</h2>
    <p>Location and Excavations:</br>
        Valsgärde is located in central Uppland, Sweden, near the River Fyrisaån, approximately 6 km from Uppsala. Excavations began in 1928 following the discovery of boat burials and concluded in 1952, unearthing over 90 graves, including boat burials, chamber graves, and cremation burials. Excavations resumed in 1994, focusing on the settlement site discovered in the 1950s.

    Cemetery Characteristics:
    <br>    
    Geography:<br>
    The cemetery is situated on a low part of the Uppsala ridge and bisected by an ancient track.
    <br>
    Early Burials:<br>
    The earliest graves date back to the pre-Roman Iron Age, featuring both inhumations and cremations linked to a large cairn.
    Roman and Vendel Periods: The cemetery expanded during the late Roman Iron Age and Vendel periods, with numerous cremation and boat burials.
    Viking Period: A structural shift occurred in the 9th century, with Viking period graves concentrated in the western part of the cemetery, including an increase in boat burials.
    <br>
        Burial Finds and Status:
        
            Boat Burials: These graves contained a wide array of items, such as weapons, horse harnesses, utensils, glass vessels, board games, and numerous animal remains, indicating high status.
            Cremation Burials: These were varied, with notable female high-status graves and the unique grave 66, a Viking Age male cremation boat burial with luxury goods.
        
        Significance:
        Valsgärde stands out for its well-preserved and minimally plundered boat burials, in contrast to other sites like Vendel and Ultuna. The cemetery reflects a transition from a multi-family burial site to one for an exclusive aristocratic group over time.
        
        Settlement Findings:
        The settlement, covering over 10,000 m², featured an aristocratic residence with a large hall and surrounding farm buildings. Archaeological findings include 7th-century buildings and evidence of specialized metalworking, suggesting continuous aristocratic occupation.
        
        Literature and Research:
        Numerous studies and publications have documented the findings at Valsgärde, contributing significantly to the understanding of the site's historical and archaeological importance.
