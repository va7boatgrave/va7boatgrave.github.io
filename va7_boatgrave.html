        <h2>Valsgärde - the place</h2>
        <h3>Location and Excavations</h3>
        <p>Valsgärde is located in central Uppland, Sweden, near the River Fyrisån, approximately 6 km from Uppsala. Excavations began in 1928 following the discovery of boat burials and concluded in 1952, unearthing over 90 graves, including boat burials, chamber graves, and cremation burials. Excavations resumed in 1994, focusing on the settlement site discovered in the 1950s.

        <h3>Cemetery Characteristics</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>Geography:</strong><br>
            The cemetery is situated on a low part of the Uppsala ridge and bisected by an ancient track.<br>
            <strong>Early Burials:</strong><br>
            The earliest graves date back to the pre-Roman Iron Age, featuring both inhumations and cremations linked to a large cairn.<br>
            <strong>Roman and Vendel Periods:</strong> The cemetery expanded during the late Roman Iron Age and Vendel periods, with numerous cremation and boat burials.<br>
            <strong>Viking Period:</strong> A structural shift occurred in the 9th century, with Viking period graves concentrated in the western part of the cemetery, including an increase in boat burials.<br>
        </p>

        <h3>Burial Finds and Status</h3>

        <p>
            <strong>Boat Burials:</strong> These graves contained a wide array of items, such as weapons, horse harnesses, utensils, glass vessels, board games, and numerous animal remains, indicating high status.<br>
            <strong>Cremation Burials:</strong> These were varied, with notable female high-status graves and the unique grave 66, a Viking Age male cremation boat burial with luxury goods.<br>
        </p>
        <p>Significance:<br>
            Valsgärde stands out for its well-preserved and minimally plundered boat burials, in contrast to other sites like Vendel and Ultuna. The cemetery reflects a transition from a multi-family burial site to one for an exclusive aristocratic group over time.<br>
        </p>
        <p>Settlement Findings:<br>
            The settlement, covering over 10,000 m², featured an aristocratic residence with a large hall and surrounding farm buildings. Archaeological findings include 7th-century buildings and evidence of specialized metalworking, suggesting continuous aristocratic occupation.<br>

        <h2>Valsgärde Boatgrave 7</h2>
        <p> The following description of the boat-grave is heavily excerpted (and slightly edited) from Arwidsson 1977, <i>Valsgärde 7</i>, p. 149-152 (a must-read in the field):</p>
        <p>Valsgärde 7 is among the richest of all the known boat-hurials from Uppland. In quantity alone the number of grave goods is exceptionally large, comprising at least 160 items, with 4 riding horses, the carcasses of an ox and a boar and a snowy owl. The character of the furnishings and the quality ofthe objects further confirm the impression that the intention was to equip the boat with all the requirements for a "long voyage".</p>
        <figure style="text-align: center;">

        </figure>
        <p>As in the other funerary boats of the Vendel Period at Valsgärde, the after part appears at first sight to have been left empty. That there is a special explan tion for this is shown particularly clearly by the distribution of the finds in Valsgärde 7. It had proved necessary here to expand the deep trench dug into the gravel to almost double the width of the boat in order to accommodate the four horses, the ox and the large boar on either side of the prow, although at least 3 m of the stern appeared to hold no cargo. <br> Since wood and other organic substances apart from bone have not been preserved except where they were in close contact with metalwork, it may be that the stern space had originally contained casks, bags (of leather or paunch skins), etc., for liquids or other organic commodities, which have since disintegrated completely.</p>

        <p>The corpse was always located amid ships, as here in Valsgärde 7, where substantial remnants of bedding with pillows and cushions were also found. The weapons were placed on and by the bed: a longsword (Schwert I) complete with baldric and a 'scramasax' or slashing knife (Sax I) to the left of the body, another longs-sword (Schwert II) to its right, and a second 'scramasax'(Sax II) across sword II and 'scramasax' I, at right-angles to the latter.
        </p>

        <p>
        On top lay the shields I—III, partly overlapping one another and deposited in the order III, I, II. In conformity with the strict ritual obviously observed at Valsgärde in the 7th and 8th centuries, a drinking vessel, namely the exceptionally large horn I, was immediately adjacent to the upper part of sword I (by its hilt and the upper part of the scabbard), while the two smaller horns II and III were placed together further forward, per haps beyond the bed.

        <p>
        Tradition also seems to have dictated the location of the helmet. In all four helmet graves of the Vendel Period they were placed roughly in the centre of the boat and somewhat apart from the corpses. In Valsgärde 7 the helmet lay in squares 5S—5N in such a position as to suggest that it had been put at or just by the foot of the bed. The distance between it and the shields — which covered both the bedding and the cutting weapons alongside the dead warrior's body — is not great, however. Directly above, around and inside the helmet were, among other things, several fragments of textiles and pillow feathers, similar to those of the bed furnishings, showing that the helmet had lain beside the bed either from the beginning or perhaps after slight displacement when the adjacent portions of the boat and the coffin/carriage decomposed and collapsed. Various fragments of wood were discovered on top of the helmet, including the wooden bowl VIII (Abb. 94) and perhaps a basket-like object or a chip box (Abb. 15). One of these wooden utensils had contained hazel nuts, a small cluster of which (Nr 1124) lay above the remains of the bowl and the other pieces of wood.
        </p>

        <figure style="text-align: center;">
            <img src="imgs/Helmet_insitu_fromAGVA7.jpeg" width="600" height="400" alt="Helmet" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;">

        </figure>

        <p>
        Since the helmet can in no circumstances be thought to have been placed on or near the head of the deceased there was lively discussion at the time of the investigation. tion as to whether it might have lain in some special box or basket, but this could not be confirmed.
        </p>
        <p>
        The dead man's bed had apparently been made up in a large coffin (originally a sea-chest?) or the carriage frame from a wagon, constructed of planks decorated on the inside, Abb. 101. These had been carefully nailed together and the joints tightly caulked with oakum.
        </p>
        <figure style="text-align: center;">

        </figure>
        <p>
        Before leaving that part of the boat where remains of the bed were observed beneath the main concentration of objects, mention must also be made of seven wooden bowls, all very fragmentary, of which reconstruction drawings can be attempted in only a few cases (Taf. 30-31). The well made bowl I lay together with bowl II near the hilt of sword I, and so very close to the interred corpse. Bowl HI, perhaps the finest of all those de- posited in Valsgiirde 7 with its carved animal head, was found just beside the tip of 'scramasax' II, in other words, also near the body. Finally above drinking horn If were a number of fragments of two wooden bowls (V and VI), of which one at least—like bowl VIII on top of the helmet—had probably contained hazel nuts. 
        </p>
        <p>
        It might appear that a certain amount of disorder can be discerned in the area extending forwards from the SW end of the coffin/wagon frame for about 1 m (in squares 4 N—S N and 5S). Apart from an axe, a pair of scissors and a bundle of tangled chainwork and collars from dog leashes, only a mass of scattered small objects and fragments were found here. In all probability there had been at least one box in this space which could have contained some of the small implements. The following have been identified among them: iron knives I and II, an iron key and three triple-plate combs with iron rivets. The same area also produced at Teast two wooden bowls (bowls IV and VII) and various scattered animal bones, However, the bronze tweezers (Nr 1142 A), strike-a-light (?), pieces of flint (Nr 1142 B) and several unused horse-hoof spikes cor roded to each other and to another piece of flint (Nr 909) lay close together beside the hilt of 'scramasax' II; they had probably been kept in a leather holder, to which one surviving fragment possibly belongs. Their position suggests that the man used to carry his firelighting equipment at his belt and it was therefore placed next to the corpse in his grave. The presence of spare ice-spikes among the grave goods is also interesting. The iron knife III was found during laboratory treatment next to the edge of the sheath of 'scramasax' I. This was probably its habitual position, i.e. it was worn alongside the slashing knife[, cf. Olsén 1945, p. 73 and Abb, 303—304].

        The personal possessions, which consistently recur in all the Vendel Period boat-burials at Valsgärde, include gaming pieces, dice and gaming boards. The gaming pieces and three dice were found in the forward part of the Valsgärde 7 boat, above and among a great mass of butchered joints of meat representing the ship's larder. The easiest explanation for this seems to me to be that there had also been a gaming board here, placed across one or two of the rowing benches or on top of a container for the meat provisions, cf. Valsgärde 8 where parts of such a board were preserved.
        </p>
        <figure style="text-align: center;">
            <img src="imgs/Spielsteine_und_Würfel.jpeg" width="600" height="400" alt="Gaming pieces" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;">
            <figcaption>Gaming pieces from Valsgärde 7 <br> Arwidsson (1977), App. II</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
        Next to the gaming pieces, the heads of at least 51 arrows were found in two bundles. The larger bundle (39 or more) had been in a quiver placed transversely across the boat, either above or under the gaming board (?), with the tips beside the starboard gunwale. The second cluster, including rather stouter, i.e. heavier, iron tips and two bone arrows for hunting fur-bearing animals, totalling at least 11, lay nearer the middle of the boat, parallel with the line of the keel. The shafts of the two set of arrows would thus have crossed one another almost at right-angles. Three more arrowheads were found scattered over squares 2 N and 3 N
        </p>
        <p>Rather more than a third of the entire length of the boat was utilised primarily as cargo space for kitchen utensils and food supplies. Apart from the articles of a different character already mentioned — the gaming pieces, dice and arrows — the only other exception to the rule reserving the forward hold for cooking equipment was the spearhead. As in Valsgirde 8, this lay by the port gunwale with its tip next to the actual stem post (in square 1 N).
        </p>
        <p>The kitchen equipment from Valsgärde 7 is exceptionally comprehensive. By the port gunwale were the fire-tongs, a roasting spit and a frying pan, probably all resting on the rowing benches, and furthest forward, right in the bows, lay the great iron cauldron complete with its suspension chains, while two wooden buckets with iron handles had stood right beside the cauldron: The cauldron fork was found outside the ship on top of the neck bones of horse IV. In the otherwise rather empty space in squares 2N—3N two large iron rings (Nr 418 and 462) mark the position of a great wooden container with iron ring-handles (a water bucket?). That the victuals had been both abundant and varied is demonstrated by the species determination of the animals of which many meat joints were found in the galley space’ of the boat. Unfortunately, a good many small fragments of bone were too poorly preserved to be identifiable. The faunal lists in the chapter Uber bleibsel von Mensch und Tieren show that most of the meat was that of the ordinary domestic animals—cattle, pig, sheep and goose. Only a few bones of Black Grouse and perhaps Mallard and Hazel Hen indicate the im- portance of wikl game. A Snowy Owl might be inter- preted as a decoy used in fowling, Pike is the only fish represented. On the other hand, it has not proved pos- sible to establish which vegetable foods were included in the diet, except for the hazel nuts found in and near at least two of the wooden bowls by the position of the corpse amidships. The nuts were mostly whole, and none showed the signs of gnawing characteristic of rodent activity.
        </p>
        <!--- From here proof-read-->
        <p>As previously mentioned, the number of unbutchered domestic animals in Valsgiirde 7 is remarkably large and the carcasses were placed outside, not inside, the ship. By the port side at the prow lay a young but full-grown ox, its back bent in a sharp curve, horse I, and a large boar, all with their heads towards the SW end of the grave, Horses II, III and IV lay in line alongside the starboard bow, facing in the same direction and so placed that I and II formed a pair, one on either side of the prow, their heads almost touching. The skull of horse III also lay very close to that of II, while the head of IV rested on the hind-quarters of horse IIL Together the three horses on the starboard side filled a channel 4 m in length and up to over 1 m wide be- tween the boat and the wall of the burial trench. Their extremities were drawn together as a rule, the hooves in most cases lying against the trench edge. Horse I, however, on the port side, lay with its fore-legs together and partly covered by its skull, and its two rear hooves against the boat's hull.</p>
        <p>No scars are visible on the skeletons of the un butchered animals which might have shown the method of slaughter. They had obviously been killed outside the burial trench and tipped in from its edge. On the port side, horse I had been inserted after ox I and probably before the boar. To starboard the horses were thrown in in the sequence H, II and IV.
        </p>
        <p>
        Three of the horses were stallions and one (II) probably a mare. All the stallions were 6—7 year-olds and so without doubt exceptionally valuable beasts, whereas the mare (?) was at least 14—15 years old. These four horses, all bridled and one (111) with its saddle as well, are a major factor contributing to the impression of outstanding wealth in Valsgiirde 7. The most lavishly decorated bridles belonged to horses II and IIL, i. probably the youngest stallion and the oldest of the animals. The snaffles and the decorative plaques from the headstall straps—of which a number of leather fragments survived—and from the reins were found in such positions that there cannot be the slightest doubt that all the horses were wearing their bridles. (A contrast may be noted here with the situa- tion in Valsgiirde 6, in which the two horses had halters on their heads, while two sumptuously ornamented bridles and a third rather plainer one were laid all to- gether some distance from the horses.)
        <p>The numerous fragments of a saddle were discovered by the fore-quarters, the very poorly preserved dorsal vertebrae and the ribs of horse III.
        <p>
        All the horses had been provided with ice-spikes in cach (2) hoof, in most cases still in position against the very tips of the extremity bones. The horses thus appear to have been equipped for movement over winter tracks and across ice. Since the spikes now show little sign of wear, they provide grounds for speculation about the time of year at which the burial took place. This was perhaps in the autumn, although of course we cannot rule out the possibility that the horses had been freshly spiked just before the interment to cater for every foreseeable transport requirement of the dead warrior.
        </p>
        <p>
        Of decoration on the ship itself, a number of ornamental iron spirals were found in clusters of threes beside both the stem and stern posts. Traces of birch bark were not discovered in Valsgärde 7, and it is most improbable that there hade ever been the kind of large tarpaulins of sewn sheets of bark that were present at both Valsgiirde 6 and Valsgärde 8.
        </p>
        <!--- Proofread V-->
        <p>
        Fragments of an exceptionally evenly woven fabric were found corroded onto many of the mounts of shields I-III and also the frying pan, much further forward towards the prow. There is a reason to believe that this cloth had either served as the ship's tarpaulin or alternatively formed the bottom layer of tentage or sheets, which had been spread over the cargo of Valsgärde 7.

        <p>Dating is based on analysis of the various artefact types represented in the Vendel Period graves at Valsgärde - taking into account the degree of wear displayed and the imperfect rejects - by comparison primarirly with counterparts at Vendel and the Gotlandic material of the period [cf. Stolpe & Arne 1912 and Nerman 1969-1975]. No attempt has been made at a comprehensive chronoligcal study of the Scandinavian and north-west European material as a whole, which must be deferred at least until all the Valsgärde graves have been published and the pending comparative analysis of the Vendel Period on Gotalnd is fully complete. Greta Arwidsson concludes that the deposition of Valsgärde7 should be dated to about 675 A.D. Many of the contents of the grave, however, had probably falls within a generation or two before the actual interment, at all events in the 2nd and 3rd quarters of the 7th century.           
        </p>
        <p>
        Radiocarbon measurements (1963) of 2 sampels from logs in the roof over the boat-burial give a date-range for the timbers of between 465±90 and 520±75 A.D. One sample from the boat itself gives the date 690±70 A.D.
