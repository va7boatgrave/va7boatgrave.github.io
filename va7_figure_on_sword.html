    Arwidsson (1977) writes:<br>
    The carved image of a bound man on the scabbard of Sword I from the Vendel period is unique. The rope, which encircles the man's neck, body, hands, and feet, is clearly interpreted as a restraint. This could be the oldest Nordic depiction of a person bound with chains or ropes. The man wears a short tunic and a pointed cap, which are typical for the period. Such depictions are not found on the scabbards of Valsgärde 6 and 8, which instead feature symbolic animal motifs.

    <p class="p-info">
    Comparisons with other depictions of prisoners, such as on Roman war reliefs or Terra Sigillata bowls, are interesting but do not help much in interpreting the image on the scabbard of Vgde 7. A Roman tombstone from the 1st century also shows bound men, indicating real situations that were significant for the deceased. Another example from the 6th century depicts a bound man on an ivory diptych in the Museo Nazionale in Ravenna, suggesting an iconographic tradition.

    <p class="p-info">
        These restraints seem to depict real practices that occurred in the artist's time and environment.

    Krogh (1970) interprets the figure as Loki, as described in <a href = "https://books.openbookpublishers.com/10.11647/obp.0308/ch8.xhtml#_idTextAnchor1218">Lokasenna</a> of the Poetic Edda.
